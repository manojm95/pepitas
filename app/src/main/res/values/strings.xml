    <string-array name="answers">
        <item>"1. Why Login is needed?"</item>
        <item>"Cloudsane is a sophisticated media sharing app with major cloud storages(Google Drive, Dropbox and Box), with rich features and awesome UI. You can share images and videos from gallery OR you can capture/record media, to directly store them into one of the cloud storages with one time configuration."</item>
        <item>"CloudSane never stores your  password. This app has no backend server or database or local storage  to store credentials. CloudSane acts as a bridge between your phone and cloud storages through powerful APIs and authentication is performed outside the scope of CloudSane."</item>
        <item>"Google Drive DropBox and Box"</item>
        <item>"Tap 'Options' and tap on 'Cloud'. It will take you to the Cloud storages settings page. In this page you can swipe on each cloud storage to Login and 'Select' the Folder to store media. You can get to know the currently selected cloud storage with a 'checked' icon on top of the cloud (Google Drive/DropBox/Box) icon"</item>
        <item>"Tap 'Options' and tap on 'Cloud'. It will take you to the Cloud storages settings page. In this page you can swipe on each cloud storage and click on the Cloud Provider name(i.e Google Drive DropBox etc). If already authenticated, the tapped cloud would be selected and you will get a tick icon on top of selected cloud logo. If not authenticated, please see the above question #4 for Login and Folder Selection help."</item>
        <item>"1. Why Login is needed?"</item>
        <item>"It gives you a option to select the quality of images(uploaded to cloud). If set to 'High' the quality of images would be with high resolution. Based on your network speed you can choose to stay with Normal quality(not poor resolution)."</item>
        <item>"You can set the number of images you can pick from gallery for upload. Please consider uploading maximum of five images aat a time to help overall performance.</item>
        <item>"This gives you option to set the quality of video to Normal or High. You can choose Normal if network speed is not high."</item>
        <item>"This lets you go for compression option for videos chosen from gallery, for upload. If this is set to 'YES' then you can upload only one video at a time."</item>
        <item>"With this option you can set a limit to the size of video file, for upload. The default is set to 20mb. If this is turned off then the 20mb limit is not considered while picking videos from gallery."</item>
        <item>"Why Login is needed?"</item>
        <item>"Please don't forget to click on 'DONE' after you select the images or videos from Gallery on each page. The 'DONE' is available on top right of every page."</item>
        <item>"The default browser that comes with certain manufacturer device doesnâ€™t parse the DROPBOX web link well and might crash when trying to authenticate. You can try different third party browsers like chrome by setting them as your default browser in your mobile device."</item>
        <item>"Restart the app by closing (even from background) and open it from app selection screen. Then go to 'Cloud' option in Menu and try authentication/folder selection again. We would receive a crash report if in case of any failure and we would start to investigate immediately. You can also send email  to contact@apptrovertscube.com to escalate issues."</item>
        <item>"a. If 'Compression' option is turned on you can upload only one video at a time. Upload can be triggered by clicking 'Done' at the top right of image selection page. There is no limit for images though.
b. Viewing the media in the cloud storage feature is not available at this time. This will be added in future releases."</item>
